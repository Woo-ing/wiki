> TODO: More features described in our [whitepaper](https://nebulas.io/docs/NebulasTechnicalWhitepaper.pdf), such as NR, PoD, DIP and NF, will be integrated into the framework in later versions very soon.

## Core Dataflow

Here is a core workflow example to explain how Nebulas works in current version. For each Nebulas node, it keeps receiving blocks or transactions from network and mining new block locally.
