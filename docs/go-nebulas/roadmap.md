# Roadmap of Nebulas

## Milestones

* In 2017 December, Nebulas test-net will be online.
* In 2018 Q1, Nebulas v1.0 will be released and main-net will be online \(ahead of the original schedules\).

### v1.0 \(2018 Q1\)

* Fully functional blockchain, with JavaScript and TypeScript as the languages of Smart Contract.
