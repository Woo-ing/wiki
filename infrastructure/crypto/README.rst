Crypto Design Doc
=================

Similar to Bitcoin and Ethereum, Nebulas also adopts elliptic curve
algorithm as its basic encryption algorithm for Nebulas transactions.
Users’ private key will be encrypted with user’s passphrases and stored
in keystore.

Hash
----

Support generic hash functions, like sha256, sha3256 and ripemd160 etc.

Keystore
--------

Nebulas Keystore are designed to manage user’s keys.

Key
~~~

The Key interface is designed to support various keys, including
symmetric keys and asymmetric keys.

Provider
~~~~~~~~

Keystore provide different methods to save keys, such as
``memory_provider`` and ``persistence_provider``. Before saved, key has
been encrypted in keystore.

-  ``memory provider``: This type of provider keep keys in memory. After
   the key has been encrypted with the passphrase when user setkey or
   load, it is cached in memory provider.
-  ``persistence provider``: This type of provider serialize the
   encrypted key to the file. The file is compatible with the ethereum’s
   keystore file，users can back up the address with its privatekey in
   it.

Signature
~~~~~~~~~

The Signature interface is used to provide applications the
functionality of a digital signature algorithm. A Signature object can
be used to generate and verify digital signatures.

There are two phases to use a Signature object for either signing data :

-  Initialization: with a private key, which initializes the signature
   for signing (see initSign() in the source code of go-nebulas).
-  Signing on all input bytes.

A Signature object can recover the public key with a signatrue and the
plain text was singed on(see function RecoverSignerFromSignature in
go-nebulas). So just comparing the from address and the address derived
from the public key can verfiy a transaction

   Similar as `Android
   Keystore <https://developer.android.com/training/articles/keystore.html>`__,
   TPM, TEE and hardware low level security protection will be supported
   as a provider later.
